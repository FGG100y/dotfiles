# Dotfiles on my Ubuntu machine
TODO:
  - dotfiles management | what is the best practice?

## using rsync to udpate dotfile repo as needed
When it comes to dotfiles, one would like to make a change and get the effects
ASAP. Make some aliases to quickly open and record new tricks, source it and
enjoy it. And regularly update the repo's then push it to remote repo so that
it can be shared to all other machines.

## Or you just want to update vimrc ...

Well, let's do it in vim and only in vim.

Combines `:sav!` and an user define vim command

1. set vim command in .vimrc:
```
command Svrc sav! ~/your-git-repo-dir/.vimrc

" then in vim, type :Svrc to save the updated .vimrc to the git repo
```
Note that the `sav!` command will open the .vimrc, the one that was in the repo
you had just saved, in the current buffer, while your working space may not in
that repo, so you need to change to that working directory. And here is the
other command.

2. set vim command in .vimrc:
```
" CC means Change to directory of Current file

command CC cd %:p:h | :e %

" then use :CC to do the trick
```
The most important was, `| :e` part in the the command would open the current
edited file again so that [fugitvie](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) an
other great tool, could recognize itself that it is in a git repo already and
make the appropriate responds. Then the fugitive took over. Sweet!

3. the other dotfiles need to config the specific command (in step 1)

## set up git bare repo for dotfiles (step by step guide is [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles))

This is trying to set up .git in a subdir say,  /home/user/baregit/, while all
the git-operation can be carried out in dir where dotfiles live (i.e., the ~).
It needs some fine-tune work with `git clone --bare` and some bash aliases.
Good idea that worth trying.

The downside (in my case) is that I don't know how to adapt the bare-git-repo
with the bash-git-prompt tool which is a really good tool.

Do not try `git add .`, it will not save your time ðŸ™„
